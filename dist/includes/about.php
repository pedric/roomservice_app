  		Here you can view all of your colleagues an find their contact-details.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		If you have admin- or owner-account, this is where you can add new users and delete the ones who don't work at your organisation anymore. The <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>-icon at the bottom right lets you add while the <i class="fa fa-minus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>-icon next to every user takes you to the deletepage.

  	<h5 id="dirtify">Dirtify</h5>
  	<p>
  		The "Dirtify-function" together with the "To do-function" is the main utility for the Clean Rooms Application. Dirtify is perfect to have open in the reception during the check-out hours in the morning, for every check-out just swipe the room number and it will disappear from the Dirtify-list and be shown at the To do-list. The cleaners will know which rooms is ready to tidy up.
  	</p>

  	<h5 id="todo">To do</h5>
  	<p>
  		As described above under "Dirtify", but in reverse! After cleaning a room or seen the sign "no roomservice" hanging from the door nob. Just swipe it from To do and it will be shown as clean, ready to be dirtified, then cleaned, dirtified and on and on..
